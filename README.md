# escape-room-barcodes
This is probably not useful to anyone else, but a little info.

Please note that the goal of this project was to finish it as quickly as possible, and because of that this is not my best work.

We were making an escape room, and we wanted to have something where you can scan barcodes to finish the room. Those are in the src/components/App/App.js file.
